A simple and responsive email template to easily check the NPS of your product

## What is this?
A very basic but responsive email template which you can use to determine the NPS of your product by simply asking their customers how likely it is, that they would recommend your product?

## Further Details
- **Important:** Make sure to remove my link target and put in your own! Otherwise you won’t be able to track your results (but thanks for the traffic).
- This template was built using the framework [Ink from ZURB](http://zurb.com/ink/)
- In order to determine the average NPS, you have to add specific tracking parameters to the numbers 1-10 (just change the href of the links)
- As everything below 8 is considered worth improving, I highly recommend sending people who clicked on 1-7 to a separate page where they can add further comments to their rating
- Everybody selecting 8-10 should just see a „thank you“ page after clicking the link
- You should send out a NPS survey in regular intervals in order check if the customer value of your product has improved over time

## What is the NPS?
Recently, a business metric has been gaining traction across a number of different industries, called the Net Promoter Score (NPS). You can read all about it if you like at www.netpromoter.com. It’s a very simple metric. You ask your customers how likely they would be to recommend your product, on a scale of 0-10. Those that rate 9 or 10 are considered “promoters” (they’re out there telling their friends how much they love your product, and are actively evangelizing for you); those that rate 7-8 are lukewarm or neutral; and those that rate 0-6, the “detractors,” are not likely to recommend your product, and may even be actively warning their friends about your product. If you take the percentage of promoters and subtract the percentage of detractors, you get the NPS. This essentially tells you if you have more people cheering for you or against you.
